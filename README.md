# Pneumonia Detection Using Deep Learning

This project aims to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It leverages deep learning techniques to assist in medical image classification tasks.

## 📌 Overview

Pneumonia is a potentially serious infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. Early and accurate detection is essential. This project uses a deep learning approach to classify X-ray images into **Pneumonia** or **Normal** categories.

## 🧠 Model Highlights

- Built using **TensorFlow/Keras**
- Utilizes **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for feature extraction and classification
- Image data augmentation techniques used to reduce overfitting
- Evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: Chest X-Ray dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)
- Contains two classes:
  - `NORMAL`
  - `PNEUMONIA`

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab)

## 📊 Results

- Training Accuracy: 
- Validation Accuracy: 
- Confusion Matrix and classification report included for detailed evaluation

## 🖼️ Sample Predictions
 
*Prediction: Pneumonia | Confidence: 95%*

Future Work
Deploy model using Streamlit/Flask for real-time prediction

Improve model accuracy with transfer learning (e.g., ResNet, VGG)

Implement explainability using Grad-CAM or LI
